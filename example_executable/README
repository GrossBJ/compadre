This folder contains an example demonstrating how to link against an installed Compadre Toolkit.

It is important that:

1.) You have installed the Compadre Toolkit
  - go to {REPO_ROOT}/build and build the toolkit
  - run ctest and verify tests pass

2.) Return to this directory and run my-do-configure-cpu.sh in the {REPO_ROOT}/example_program/build folder
