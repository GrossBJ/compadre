This folder contains an example demonstrating how to link against an installed Compadre Toolkit.

It is important that:

1.) You have installed the Compadre Toolkit
  - go to {REPO_ROOT}/build and build the toolkit
  - run ctest and verify tests pass

2.) Return to extern_example/build and run my-do-configure-cpu.sh in the {REPO_ROOT}/extern_example/build folder
  - this will populate the .cpp files and .py file
  - run 'make -j' to build the executables
  - you can execute the C++ compiled programs by running either:

     {REPO_ROOT}/extern_example/build/run_gpu_program.sh
    or
     {REPO_ROOT}/extern_example/build/run_cpu_program.sh
 
    depending on what configuration you used to build Kokkos
  
  - the Python test can be executed by running "python {REPO_ROOT}/extern_example/build/gmls_3d_convergence.py"
